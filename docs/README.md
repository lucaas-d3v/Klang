# Klang — A Polyglot Programming Language

Klang is an experimental programming language focused on **clarity**, **deterministic semantics**, and **real polyglot interoperability**.  
Designed and developed by ~K’, Klang aims to provide a predictable, minimal and expressive syntax while enabling modules to target multiple language backends.

---

## Vision

Klang is built to:

- provide a simple and predictable syntax,
- enable direct interoperability with Java, Python, Go, Rust, and C,
- support modular compilation and controlled transpilation,
- act as a bridge between ecosystems rather than a competitor.

> Klang exists to connect languages — not to replace them.

---

## Philosophy

- readability first  
- deterministic behavior  
- minimal and explicit syntax  
- isolated transpilation units  
- polyglot by design

## Example Syntax

```k
if (x > 0) {
    println("Positive");
} afterall {
    println("Zero or negative");
}
````

## Roadmap

* [ ] Stable lexer
* [ ] Parser + AST
* [ ] Java transpiler
* [ ] CLI (build / run / transpile)
* [ ] Syntax specification v1
* [ ] Modular interoperability
* [ ] Basic runtime

Current priority: **lexer → parser → AST**.
